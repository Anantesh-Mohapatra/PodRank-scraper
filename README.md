Project: PodRank
Team: Anantesh Mohapatra & Rinna Zhang

This project scrapes podcast categories and top podcast rankings from the Spotify US Chart on the Chartable website. Users can choose a podcast category, and the script will return the top 3 podcasts in that category. This allows users to easily find popular podcasts based on live data from Chartable.

How to Use the Program:
1. First, clone the repository to your local machine
2. Create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies
3. Install all the required Python packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Execute the script to start the scraping process
5. After running the script, you'll be asked to enter a category (e.g., comedy, business, news). The script will then display the top 3 podcasts for that category, including their rank, title, and a link to the podcast
6. The top 3 podcasts in the selected category will be printed in the terminal with relevant details

*This was a project for a class at NYU Stern - the fork was created because both team members needed to create a repository on GitHub.*
